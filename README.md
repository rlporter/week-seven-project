1)You are going to build an application to track personal statistics about their activities. A personal statistic is a numerical record for a person in a time series by day.

2)Users of your application can create as many different activities to track as they want.

3)You will be building an API to create and serve this data backed by MongoDB.

4)For your API, we have specified the endpoints you'll need and what they should do. The URLs we are using are not prefixed: yours should have /api/ in front of them.

5)All the endpoints require authentication. You can use JSON Web Tokens for authentication, or if you prefer, you can use HTTP Basic Authentication. Feel free to use Passport to make this part easier.

Verb	URL	Action
GET	/activities	Show a list of all activities I am tracking, and links to their individual pages
POST	/activities	Create a new activity for me to track.
GET	/activities/{id}	Show information about one activity I am tracking, and give me the data I have recorded for that activity.
PUT	/activities/{id}	Update one activity I am tracking, changing attributes such as name or type. Does not allow for changing tracked data.
DELETE	/activities/{id}	Delete one activity I am tracking. This should remove tracked data for that activity as well.
POST	/activities/{id}/stats	Add tracked data for a day. The data sent with this should include the day tracked. You can also override the data for a day already recorded.
DELETE	/stats/{id}	Remove tracked data for a day.
